A simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. Play with a friend!

This project taught me to use modules and factory functions. I kept as much out of global scope as possible - in fact, there shouldn't be anything in global scope unless I've had a serious misunderstanding.

I also didn't put too much time into the design, so don't pay too much attention to it - the purpose was mainly to practice newly-learned JavaScript. I could still add some mouseover hover effects and implement an AI. 

Feedback is always welcome.
